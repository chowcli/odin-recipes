      <li>200g mini mochi</li>
      <li>80g buckwheat, toasted</li>
      <h5>CHOCOLATE MOUSSE</h5>
      <li>270g dark chocolate, chopped</li>
      <li>260ml thickened cream, plus 450ml extra</li>
      <li>85g caster sugar</li>
      <li>9 (135g) egg yolks</li>
      <h5>SALTED CARAMEL</h5>
      <li>200g caster sugar</li>
      <li>200ml thickened cream</li>
      <li>40g unsalted butter, chopped</li>
      <li>1 tsp Murray River pink sea salt</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        For the mousse, place chocolate in a large bowl. Heat cream in a small
        saucepan until almost boiling, then pour over the chocolate. Stand for 1
        minute. Whisk until combined. Set ganache aside and keep warm to prevent
        it firming too much.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place sugar in a small saucepan with 50ml water. Cook, stirring, over
        medium heat until sugar has dissolved. Increase heat to high and cook,
        without stirring, until syrup reaches 115°C on a sugar thermometer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat egg
        yolks until pale. Slowly add the hot syrup to gently cook the yolks.
        Fold mixture through the chocolate ganache until thoroughly combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate medium bowl, whisk the extra cream until soft peaks form.
        Gently fold through the chocolate mixture in 3 batches. Cover and chill
        for at least 3 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the salted caramel, place sugar in a high-sided, heavy- based pot
        over medium-high heat and leave untouched until sugar dissolves evenly,
        then gently swirl pan until sugar reaches a dark golden color, around
        166°C. Reduce heat to low and whisk cream in slowly to incorporate
        evenly. Remove pan from heat and whisk in butter, one piece at a time,
        until melted and well incorporated. Whisk in sea salt. Transfer to a
        large bowl and set aside for 20 minutes to cool slightly before serving
        (if left for too long, the caramel will firm up too much).
      </li>
      <li>
        Scoop a big spoonful of chocolate mousse into a serving bowl and make a
        well in the middle. Add a dollop of creme fraiche into the well. Make a
        well in the middle of the creme fraiche. Add a dollop of the salted
        caramel into the well. Top generously with mochi pieces and toasted
        buckwheat to serve.
